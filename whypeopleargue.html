      <h1>WHY PEOPLE ARGUE</h1>

      <p>People argue because they live in different worlds. Each of them is right in their own reality, which is why arguing is pointless. Yet arguments—and aggression—arise when one person and their world try to swallow another person and their world. But that can never happen. Their world is part of the infinite variations of reality, and those variations cannot disappear. No one can touch them.</p>
      <p>What can happen, however, is persuasion—but only by free will. If you shake the legs of the chair someone sits on in their world, you might lure them into sitting in yours.</p>
      <p>In truth, this isn’t about a swing absorbing energy. The system doesn’t care whether you eventually switch sides or remain locked in a heated argument. Its only goal is to draw energy from you—the energy you willingly give.</p>
      <p>What truly angers you is the feeling of shaky chair legs beneath you—the sense that your position is weak, that something inside you was swayed away, that some inner part of you betrayed itself. It feels like you’ve betrayed yourself. That’s what burns inside.</p>
      <p>When that happens, pause and ask yourself: Will what the other side offers bring me more benefit than the chair I’m sitting on now?</p>
      <p>If yes, then move.</p>
      <p>If yes, but it’s not worth it for you, then stay.</p>
      <p>If no, then stay.</p>
      <p>This is your chair. The shaking you feel is an illusion. Ignore it, and they’ll leave you alone.</p>
      <p>But if the urge to take revenge overwhelms you, if you try to shake the legs of their chair, you’re doing exactly what they want. The swing will keep absorbing your energy. You’ll still waste your time. You’ll still fail to sit firmly enough so that their barking makes you laugh instead of rage.</p>
      <p>And you still won’t see the truth: it’s you shaking your own chair.</p>
      <p>They’re only whispering to your soul, making you believe it’s them. In reality, all they want is for you to do the shaking. And you play along.</p>
      <p>So laugh. Laugh hard. Laugh until it drowns out the noise.</p>
