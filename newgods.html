      <h1> Floating Among the Gods:</h1> 
      <h2>Depths, New Powers, and the Unseen </h2>
     
<p>I recently listened to a podcast that left me feeling profoundly peaceful — like a lonely whale floating on the surface of the night’s ocean. There’s a unique kind of calm in encountering ideas you both agree and disagree with, in finding resonance in the tension itself.</p>

<p>It made me reflect on something that has always puzzled me: the panic of the Old Gods when the new ones arrive. Social media, AI, and other forces now sweeping through our culture — these are the new gods of our time. They may rule the surface for a while, but the true measure of their power is deeper. Only those who can dive into the depths of the ocean — who can navigate the unseen, the hidden currents, the subconscious — will earn their rightful place at the table.</p>

<p>There’s no greater show for me than witnessing someone earn that place. Growth is messy. Yes, they will stumble — sometimes spectacularly — but that is the process. The Old Gods should remember that they, too, were once new.</p>

<p>And then there’s the personal side of this cosmic reflection. Some people possess a rare depth — what I like to call “double 12th-house power.” In astrology, the 12th house governs the unseen: our subconscious, spiritual insight, hidden potential, and karmic patterns. Most of us navigate life mostly on the surface, but some have this house amplified, with multiple planets emphasizing its domain. They are uniquely attuned to intuition, inner growth, and the mysteries others rarely perceive.</p>

<p>When I say “Not everyone has double 12 houses at their disposal,” I mean that not everyone carries this rare combination of insight and depth. It’s a subtle power, invisible yet transformative. It’s what allows someone to navigate the new currents without losing themselves, to earn their place among the gods of their time.</p>

<p>In a world constantly enthralled by novelty and noise, perhaps the most extraordinary act is this: diving deep, embracing the unseen, and letting the process of growth — stumbles, triumphs, and all — reveal the person you are becoming.</p>
