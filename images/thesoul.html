      <h1>What Is a Soul?</h1>

      

<p>The truth is, I don’t know. I have no certain answer, and perhaps there isn’t one.</p>

<p>I remember, once, during our criminalistics class, our professor took us to observe an autopsy. While he turned pale and struggled to stay upright, I felt something closer to disappointment. There was nothing transcendent in what I saw — only the quiet machinery of the body, methodically opened and examined.</p>
<p>In that moment, I understood absence. The body was intact, yet whatever had animated it was gone. It was a house emptied of its tenant, matter stripped of meaning. For a few days afterward, my thoughts and emotions receded. There was no fear in that silence — only a peculiar peace, as if detachment itself were a kind of truth.</p>
<p>
On the way home, I bought strawberry ice cream. It was absurdly good, vivid, almost defiant in its simplicity. Perhaps that was my body reasserting itself — reminding me of the immediate, the tangible.</p>
<p>
But before leaving that room, I caught myself whispering to the still form, “Don’t worry, you’ll be born again.” I don’t know why I said it. Maybe that impulse — to reach toward something beyond reason — is what we call the soul.</p>
<p>
In the years since, I’ve met people with brilliant intellects, their minds alive with precision and logic, yet possessing less soul than that body on the table.</p>
