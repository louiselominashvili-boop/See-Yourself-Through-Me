      <h1>  How Does It Feel to Have Friends? </h1>

      <p>How does it feel to have friends? I don’t really know in the way people usually mean. What I do know is that belonging doesn’t only come from people. For me, it has always come from animals—especially <strong><u>cats.</u></strong></p>
        
      <p> Even before I was born, they were there. When my mother was about to give birth to me, two house cats stayed close to her, calming her presence with theirs. It feels meaningful, as if comfort and protection surrounded me before I ever entered the world. From the beginning, <strong><u> connection did not need words.</u></strong> </p> 
        
      <p>Throughout my life, cats have been my emotional anchors. When I was far away from home, what I missed most was not a place but a feeling—peace. And peace sounded like the soft purring of a cat sleeping nearby. In those moments, I understood that love does not have to be loud to be powerful. Sometimes it is simply warmth, rhythm, and quiet companionship.</p>
        
      <p> I would sometimes dream that I was inside a cat’s belly—safe, held, wrapped in comfort and gentle <u>
      purring</u>.  Those dreams reflected something deeper: the instinctive sense of protection and belonging I have always felt with them. My connection to cats has never felt learned or chosen; it has felt natural, lifelong, and deeply rooted.</p>
        
      <p>To me, cats have always seemed like mystical beings, carrying a calm strength and a quiet, protective energy. Only recently did I realize something simple yet profound: <strong>cats may have the biggest hearts in the world</strong>. When they love you, they love you fully, without conditions or expectations.</p>
        
      <p> This is what my essay teaches me now—that friendship can exist without words, that <strong> sensitivity is a strength</strong>, and that love often arrives in quiet forms. Belonging can come from unexpected places, and sometimes the truest companionship is found in those who simply stay, purr, and make you feel safe. ❤️
