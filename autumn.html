    <h1> The Autumn </h1> 
    <h2> Suffocating love of particular season </h2>

    <p>
        How can I love autumn? It’s the only period of time when the sun shines differently through the clouds—so cold, so distant. It starts with September and ends with November. In the middle lies October, with all its spookiness and coziness. 
        
        The sweetness of fall feels suffocating to me, because schools and teachers ruined its main concept. They made it seem like a beginning, when in reality, it’s the end.

        But I can alter my perception of autumn and imagine it as an elf king of a mysterious forest.
        When I find the magic in it, everything feels easier, and all the fog disappears.
        
       <p> This applies to anything. We just need to create a specific story to change the narrative of a given reality.</p>
