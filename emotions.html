      <h1>  Emotions </h1>
      <h2><strong>A.K.A</strong> Reclaiming Inner Self </h2> 


    <p>Emotions have always been a mystery to me. Growing up, I experienced them, but I couldn’t name them, understand them, or express them safely. In my home, showing how I felt was treated as a flaw. If I cried, I was told I was weak. If I said I was sad or hurt by how I was treated, I was told the same thing. Little by little, I learned to hide anything I felt, not because those emotions were wrong, but because the environment around me punished honesty and vulnerability.</p>
    
    <p>As a child, I didn’t realize the impact this would have. I only knew that if I showed discomfort or tried to protect myself—whether from unfairness or from any hurtful behavior—I would be met with blame instead of understanding. My reactions were treated as weakness, rather than normal human emotions. Because of this, I grew up believing that feelings were dangerous, that they exposed me, and that they made me less worthy.</p>
    
    <p>Now I understand something important: this was never my fault. I was raised by people who did not know <u>how to handle emotions—neither theirs nor mine.</u> Emotional intelligence was absent in my home, and as a result, I never received the guidance or the example I needed. I wasn’t weak; I was simply a child trying to survive in an environment that didn’t allow emotional expression.</p>
    
    <p>Today, I can see that my difficulty understanding other people’s emotions—and sometimes even my own—<strong>is not a flaw in my character.</strong> It is a sign of the emotional wounds I carried from childhood. And instead of blaming myself for these struggles, I am learning to approach them with compassion. Healing means getting closer to myself, not running away from what I feel. It means giving myself permission to name my emotions, to feel them fully, and to see them as necessary parts of who I am.</p>
    
    <p> <strong> Understanding myself is not about rewriting the past but about reclaiming what was taken from me:</strong> the right to feel. I am learning that emotions are not a sign of weakness, but a reflection of humanity. I am learning that loving myself means accepting every part of my inner world—even the parts that once scared me. And most importantly, I am realizing that healing is possible, because I am no longer trapped in the environment that silenced me.</p>
    
    <p>This journey is not about perfection. It is about growth, patience, and rediscovering the emotional language I was never taught. Little by little, I am finding my way back to myself—and <strong>that is strength, not weakness.
