    <h1>   Who Are the Angels? </h1> 
    <h2> Question of the Century. </h2>
    
    <p>Will I have an answer? Or do I already have it? Who knows.</p>

<p>Who is my guardian angel? I was speaking to my guardian angel, and now they tell me it’s me. I know that’s just a path, you know… because I once said I would not give a face to my guardian angel — may they have their true face, whatever it may be. I will accept, love, and celebrate my guardian angel.</p>

<p>And now they are telling me: “If that is so, then I am you.”</p>

<p>Isn’t that beautiful? It is… but it is also frightening. I will, and I am, loving myself — but at the same time I know you are real. You are with me — angel of the Lord, my friend, my guardian, my love.</p>

<p>My guardian angel has a great sense of humour, and that helps me stay in higher frequencies.</p>

<p>Angels are warriors of God, aren’t they? Everybody says so. But I think, whoever they are, God loves them very much.</p>
