      When the world feels chaotic and overwhelming, sometimes the simplest solution is to bake a healthy cake. Why? Because enjoying something delicious can lift your mood—your “frequency,” as some people put it—and help shift your perspective. Maybe we can’t control every part of our destiny, but we can choose which path to focus on. After all, there are many possible futures.</p>

      Before exams, I always ate something I loved. It wasn’t just a treat; it was science. Positive chemical reactions in your body boost happiness hormones, which help you face stressful situations with a clearer mind. Sometimes all you need is a new point of view—a new variant of reality you can step into. So bake. And eat.</p>

      Does your cake need to look like a piece of art? Not at first. But with practice, your baking begins to reflect both beauty and skill—delicious on the inside and beautiful on the outside </p>
