    <h1> Barbie </h1>
    <h2>Why did I stop being a Barbie girl?</h2>

    <p> I don’t really know. Maybe it began the moment I tried to feel beautiful and was taught not to. Every time I reached for sparkle, pink, or softness, my parents made sure I felt ugly—disgusting, unworthy of anything delicate or bright. As if beauty was something I was not allowed to touch.</p>
    
   <p> My father—who I believe may be autistic—carried so much disgust, negativity, and rejection toward me that it slowly destroyed my ability to function as a whole human being. His constant disapproval seeped into my skin, my thoughts, my sense of self. Still, now that I am grown, I know I should no longer seek their approval. I see my parents more clearly: broken children who did the best they could with the tools they had.</p>
    
   <p>And yet the wounds remain.</p>
    
   <p>Now that I can recognize my pain—my insecurities that make me feel filthy, stinky, and ashamed—I wonder if healing might look like reclaiming what I was denied. Maybe I should buy those Barbie-like things: a Barbie thermos, Barbie slippers, small pink objects that once symbolized joy and safety. But every time I plan to do it, I change my mind.</p>
    
   <p>Maybe I am not healed yet.</p>
   <p>Or maybe I am simply not that child anymore.</p>
    
   <p> I ask myself: would buying those things be growth, or weakness? Would it be an act of self-love—or an act of exposure? Like showing my soft belly to wolves while I am still bleeding. Would they smell the blood?</p>
    
   <p>Perhaps the real question is not whether I have moved on, but whether I am allowed to be gentle with myself now. Whether reclaiming softness is dangerous—or brave. Whether loving the parts of me that were once shamed is not regression, but quiet resistance.</p>
