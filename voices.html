    <h2>Riding Through the Noise: How I Learned to Drive My Mind</h2>
    <p>
       

        Once, I was traveling from one city to another—a three-hour journey on a scorching summer day. The asphalt was blazing hot, and the air was heavy. The driver of the minibus turned on the air conditioner, but it wasn’t strong enough to reach the passengers near me. Soon, the people sitting behind me started loudly demanding that those in front roll down the windows. The driver grew frustrated, insisting that turning on the AC was the best solution. <br><br>
        
        What started as a verbal argument quickly escalated into a physical confrontation. The driver stopped the bus, and the passengers were forced to get off and confront each other. This man—the driver—did not discriminate; he confronted everyone, men and women alike, with equal force. After the fight, everyone got back on the bus. The windows were shut, the air conditioner was off, and for the entire three hours, nobody spoke a word. We all suffered in silence, barely able to breathe, but we made it to our destination.<br><br>
        
        This chaotic ride reminds me of a psychological concept I once learned: the “Bus Model” of the mind. Imagine your mind is a bus, and you are the driver. The “passengers” are the voices inside your head—those negative, self-critical thoughts telling you that you’re not good enough, that you’re ugly or unworthy. The goal is to develop the skill to simply ignore these passengers and keep driving toward your destination, no matter how loud or aggressive they get.<br><br>
        
        But for me, that peaceful scenario didn’t work.<br><br>
        
        When those negative voices attack me, I recall that journey and imagine myself as that bus driver—someone who stood up and fought back against those passengers. To make it even more humorous, I assign my neighbors’ names to these voices. Some get kicked out the window violently, others get shoved with a kick in the back or pushed through the door. Sometimes I stop the bus; sometimes it drives without a driver. I am the driver at the wheel, physically standing up to the voices that try to drain my energy.<br><br>
        
        At first, this mental exercise was intense and cathartic. Eventually, those voices became afraid of me—even a simple glare was enough to silence them. When they whisper sad or painful things, I sometimes feel pity for them because, after all, they only carry pain—they aren’t truly my enemies. Now, I usually just laugh at their ridiculous comments, knowing exactly what process we’ll go through—and I keep driving, steadily at the wheel.<br><br>
